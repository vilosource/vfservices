always test using traefik endpoints.
when implementing views for the django projects always write a plywright smoke test. The tests should be written in playwright/<Django Project Name>/smoke-tests/. Always create a README.md about each test implemented and also how  to run the test
Use docker compose instead of docker-compose command
Remember that the common librarary used by Django projects is in the root of the project directory
