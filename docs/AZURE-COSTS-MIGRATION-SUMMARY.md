# Azure Costs JWT Authentication Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated azure-costs service from complex DRF authentication to the simpler billing-api approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed REST_FRAMEWORK Configuration
**File:** `/azure-costs/main/settings.py`

**Before:**
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'common.jwt_auth.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ],
    'DEFAULT_PARSER_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.parsers.JSONParser',
    ],
}
```

**After:** Completely removed

### 2. Removed Custom Authentication Class
**File:** `/azure-costs/common/jwt_auth/authentication.py`

**Status:** Deleted entirely

### 3. Simplified Views
**File:** `/azure-costs/azure_costs/views.py`

**Before:** Custom permission handling with empty permission classes
```python
@permission_classes([])  # Empty list to bypass default permissions
def private(request):
    # Manual authentication checks
    if not user.is_authenticated:
        return Response({"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."}, ...)
```

**After:** Standard DRF permissions
```python
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def private(request):
    # DRF handles authentication automatically
```

### 4. Cleaned Up Debug Logging
**Files:** `middleware.py` and `views.py`

- Removed verbose debug statements
- Restored normal logging levels
- Kept essential logging for monitoring

## Results

### ✅ Authentication Works
- Cross-service authentication from CIELO → Azure Costs works correctly
- JWT cookies are properly handled by middleware
- DRF's `@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])` works as expected

### ✅ Authorization Works  
- RBAC roles are loaded correctly (`costs_manager`, `costs_admin`)
- Role-based access control functions properly
- User attributes are available via `request.user_attrs`

### ✅ Tests Pass
- Playwright integration tests pass
- Manual curl tests confirm functionality
- Both authenticated and unauthenticated access work as expected

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No custom DRF authentication classes needed
2. **Consistent with Billing-API**: Both services now use the same approach
3. **Less Code to Maintain**: Removed ~70 lines of custom authentication code
4. **Clearer Intent**: DRF decorators work intuitively without workarounds

## Technical Explanation

The migration works because:

1. **JWT Middleware runs first** and sets `request.user` to a properly authenticated user object
2. **DRF's IsAuthenticated permission** simply checks `request.user.is_authenticated` 
3. **No custom authentication classes** means DRF doesn't override the middleware's work
4. **Standard DRF patterns** work naturally without custom integration code

This approach is simpler and more maintainable than the previous complex integration between DRF authentication classes and JWT middleware.
